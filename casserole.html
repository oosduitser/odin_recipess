    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My mom liked to make the Hamburger Helper® version 
        of this recipe. When I moved to another state, 
        I could not find it, so I came up with this. Memories of home.
         My hubby likes for me to spice this up sometimes, 
         so I will use a 14-ounce can of tomatoes and green chiles 
         in it or just use a Mexican-style cornbread mix sometimes.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
             <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
             <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
             <li>2 (15 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
             <li>1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn</li>
             <li>1 (6 ounce) box cornbread mix</li>
             <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
             <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>

         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
             <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. 
                 Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
                  5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. 
                  Season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
             <li>Stir onion into the ground beef; cook and stir for 1 minute 
                 and immediately remove skillet from heat.</li>
             <li>Stir pinto beans and crushed tomatoes into the beef mixture.</li>
             <li>Beat cream-style corn, cornbread mix, and egg together in a bowl until smooth;
                  spread over the top of the ground beef mixture in the skillet.
                   Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the corn mixture.</li>
             <li>Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the cornbread is set in the
                  middle, about 25 minutes.</li>
         </ol>
